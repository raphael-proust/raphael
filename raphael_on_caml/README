##Foreword

This folder contains raphael bindings for the js_of_ocaml compiler. It is
included in a raphael repository in order to keep track of the raphael project.
This binding doesn't include raphael's code in anyway.

##Usage

Information will be made available as development progresses. Basically what you
need to do is build the library, use the built parts in your client code and
ship both raphael.js and your compiled client code into a web page.
